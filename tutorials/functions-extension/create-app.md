# Create your local Function App

First, create a local Azure Functions app. An Azure Functions app can contain many Functions with various triggers - this tutorial focuses on HTTP triggers, which allow you to handle to incoming HTTP traffic.

In VS Code, expande the Azure Functions explorer and click the create project icon.

Choose an empty directory for the app then select JavaScript for the language of your Functions App.

VS Code will reload and your new local Functions app will be loaded into your workspace.

## Create a new Function

Next, create a Function that handles HTTP requests.

From the Azure Functions explorer, click the create function icon.

Select the directory you currently have open - it's the default option so simply hit enter. When prompted, choose HTTP trigger, use the default name of `HttpTriggerJS`, and choose anonymous authentication, .

Upon completion, a new directory is created within your Function app named `HttpTriggerJS` that includes an `index.js` file. This file contains the code that responds to the HTTP request.

## Run the application

Upon creating the Function App, the necessary VS Code launch configuration was added to your project. To run the project locally, simply hit F5. This will launch and attach to the Azure Functions host - this is the same runtime that runs on Azure so you can be sure that your code runs the same locally as it does when deployed.

Hit F5 to launch the debugger. Output from the Functions Core tools is displayed in the VS Code terminal window. Once the host has started up, the local URL for your Function is written out. Super+Click the URL to open it in your browser.

The default HTTP template parses a `name` query parameter to customize the response, add `?name=<yourname>` to the URL in your browser to see the response output correctly.

After verifying that the app runs locally, it's time to publish it to Azure Functions.
